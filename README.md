# Gold Price Prediction Model

## Overview

This project aims to predict future gold prices based on historical data and various financial indicators using a machine learning approach. The model is built using the Random Forest Regressor algorithm, which is well-suited for handling non-linear relationships and preventing overfitting. The project involves data preprocessing, feature analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualization of predictions.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature selection, and data normalization.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Correlation analysis and statistical summaries to understand the data.
- **Modeling**: Implementation of a Random Forest Regressor to predict gold prices.
- **Evaluation**: Model performance assessment using R-squared error.
- **Visualization**: Heatmaps for correlation, distribution plots, and comparison of actual vs. predicted prices.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `pandas`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project consists of historical gold prices and related financial indicators. The data should be in CSV format, with columns including but not limited to:

- Date
- Gold Price (GLD)
- Crude Oil Prices
- Stock Indices
- Currency Exchange Rates

Place the dataset file (`gold_price_dataset.csv`) in the project's root directory.

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gold-price-prediction.git
   cd gold-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Run the script**:
   ```bash
   python gold_price_prediction.py
   ```

3. **Output**:
   - The script will output the model's predictions, the R-squared error, and plots comparing actual vs. predicted gold prices.

## Key Files

- `gold_price_prediction.py`: The main script containing the data processing, modeling, and evaluation code.
- `gold_price_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Results

The model's predictions are evaluated using the R-squared metric, with results indicating a strong predictive capability. The actual vs. predicted gold prices are visualized to demonstrate the model's accuracy.

## Future Work

- Integrate additional financial indicators to improve prediction accuracy.
- Experiment with other machine learning models like XGBoost or Gradient Boosting Machines.
- Deploy the model as a web service for real-time predictions.
